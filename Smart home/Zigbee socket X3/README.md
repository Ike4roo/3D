# A 3D printing model of Zigbee-socket

Just print all parts, install and connect ceramic sockets, cheap zigbee (or WiFi with the same dimensions) module - just remove housing, socket with fuse module and sif it with 2.5x10 mm screws. Do not forget to solder wires according to electrical rules (all sockets are in parallel) and vendor recommendations.
At least 1.0mm2 of copper wire for 10A fuse.
